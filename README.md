# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in multiple programming languages. Currently, implementations are available in C++ and C, with plans to include other languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, ....  in the future.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Languages
- **[C++](https://github.com/OMar-Adelll/Sorting_Algorithms/tree/main/C%2B%2B)**: Implementations of sorting algorithms in C++.
- **[C](https://github.com/OMar-Adelll/Sorting_Algorithms/tree/main/C)**: Implementations of sorting algorithms in C.
- *Other Languages*: Coming soon!

## Visualization of Sorting Algorithms
To better understand how sorting algorithms work, explore these visualization tools and resources:
- **[USFCA Sorting Visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html)**: An interactive tool to visualize comparison-based sorting algorithms.
- **[Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting)**: Another interactive tool for visualizing sorting algorithms.
- **[Toptal Sort Visualizer](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms)**: Animated visualizations of sorting algorithms.
- *Custom Visualizations*: Plans to include custom visualization code in the future.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the desired language folder (e.g., `cpp/` or `c/`).
3. Compile and run the code using the appropriate compiler:
   - For C++: `g++ filename.cpp -o output && ./output`
   - For C: `gcc filename.c -o output && ./output`
